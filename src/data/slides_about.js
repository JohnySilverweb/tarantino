      "At the age of 16, with his mother’s permission, he dropped out of school; however, she set one condition: he had to find a job. And so, Quentin became an usher at a adult movie theater. However, this job did not resonate with him. Tarantino loved real cinema and considered porn cheap, unpleasant, and boring.",

      "While working there, Tarantino, along with two of his friends, began shooting his first film titled My Best Friend’s Birthday. However, a fire broke out in the place where the film reels were stored, destroying all the director’s work.

      "After the failure of his amateur film My Best Friend’s Birthday, Tarantino got a job at the video rental store Video Archives. There, he continued writing scripts. In 1989, through mutual acquaintances, he met producer Lawrence Bender, who advised him to write something that could be made cheaply and to take the script to film festivals.",

      "Before that, Tarantino had already tried to sell his work: he passed the scripts for True Romance and Natural Born Killers through actor friends and industry contacts until one copy reached agents in Hollywood. These scripts began circulating among studios, which drew attention to his name. Impressed by his ideas, Bender showed their script for Reservoir Dogs to his contacts, which led to financing and the film’s production.",
